I use mysql and php to build this web-based parking register system
The "PARKINGMASTER_create.sql" script file will automatically create a database called PARKINGMASTER
and will automatically load the database. The script will create the tables needed for the database. 
In order to run the script file you will need to use the source command followed by the path of the 
script file (source C:\PARKINGMASTER_create.sql). The "PARKINGMASTER_insert.sql" will automatically
populate the tables with data. In order to run this script you will need to use the source command
followed by the path of the script file (source C:\PARKINGMASTER_insert.sql). The php file that will
need to be run first will be the "register.php".
